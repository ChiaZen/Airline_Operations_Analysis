## Project Background Information
This project demonstrates a practical application of data analysis and operations research in the airline industry,  focusing on crew planning optimization, delay impact analysis, and operational forecasting. Built using Python and Streamlit, this interactive app simulates real-world constraints airlines face and proposes data-driven solutions.

## Objectives
1. Optimize crew scheduling under regulatory and operational constraints.
2. Simulate the impact of flight delays on crew availability.
3. Forecast crew demand based on scheduled flights and seasonal variations.
4. Deliver a responsive Streamlit dashboard for scenario testing.
